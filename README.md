# SatVarDiv - Calculate Saturation of Diversity Variables
Rarefaction-like analyses to calculate saturation of biological diversity variables.

This code repository contains an R script used in Karbstein et al. 2020 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6255) to calculate saturation of diversity variables per population/location (intraspecific functional trait diversity, within-habitat heterogeneity, and genetic diversity based on microsatellite/SSR data (rarefaction-like analyses).  

This is an exemplary script to perform this type of analysis, and you will need to adapt the directory paths to your system or install required packages. Data from the study by Karbstein et al. (2020) are given as an example (test folder = try the R script on your own based on the provided datasets, results folder = output of the function). Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions for improvement.
