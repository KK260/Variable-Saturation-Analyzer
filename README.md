# SatVarDiv - Calculate saturation of diversity variables
Rarefaction-like analyses to calculate saturation of biological diversity variables.

This code repository contains an R script used in Karbstein et al. 2020 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6255) to calculate saturation of diversity variables per population/location (intraspecific functional trait diversity, within-habitat heterogeneity, and genetic diversity based on microsatellite/SSR data (rarefaction-like analyses).  

This is a sample script to perform this type of analysis, and you will need to adapt the local directory paths to your system or install the required packages. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions for improvement.
