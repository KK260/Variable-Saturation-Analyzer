Rarefaction-like analyses to calculate saturation of diversity variables

This code repository includes an R script used in Karbstein et al. (submitted) to calculate saturation of diversity variables per population/location (intraspecific functional trait diversity, within-habitat heterogeneity and genetic diversity based on SSR data (rarefaction-like analyses).  

This is an exemplary script to perform these kind of analyses, and you have to adjust the local directory paths to your own system or install some packages. I hope that this exemplary R script was useful for you to calculate saturation of diversity variables. Please do not hesitat to contact me, also if you have improvement suggestions (https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/staff/185774.html)!
